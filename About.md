## About Trax Fitness

Trax Workout Tracker is built on a simple idea — to create a seamless, intelligent way to track workouts without the hassle of manual entries. Our AI-powered wearable device uses advanced motion sensors to detect and classify exercises, track repetitions and sets, and provide long-term insights into your fitness journey. The technology is designed to let you focus on your workout, while Trax takes care of the rest, ensuring you can consistently track your progress and reach your goals.

The Trax Workout Tracker is currently under development. We are actively building and testing parts of our prototypes on our own time, alongside our full-time jobs and academic pursuits.
