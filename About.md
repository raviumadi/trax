## About Trax Fitness

Trax Fitness Tracker is built on a simple idea — to create a seamless, intelligent way to track workouts without the hassle of manual entries. Our AI-powered wearable device uses advanced motion sensors to detect and classify exercises, track repetitions and sets, and provide long-term insights into your fitness journey. The technology is designed to let you focus on your workout, while Trax takes care of the rest, ensuring you can consistently track your progress and reach your goals.

### A Work in Progress

The Trax Fitness Tracker is currently under development. We are actively building and testing parts of our prototypes on our own time, alongside our full-time jobs and academic pursuits. This passion project has evolved from our shared love of fitness and technology, and we are excited to see it grow.

### Seeking Funding

As we continue to refine our prototypes and develop the technology, we are looking for funding opportunities to take Trax to the next level. If you are interested in supporting a revolutionary approach to fitness tracking, we’d love to hear from you!
