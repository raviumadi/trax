    Trax Myophone is a unique wearable device designed to be worn on the target muscle during activities like lifting, isolated movements, or any exercise where muscle engagement is key. This innovative technology translates surface EMG (electromyography) signals into audible feedback through your regular earphones, allowing you to listen to your muscle activation in real-time.
    </p>
    <p style="font-size: 18px; max-width: 800px; margin: auto; margin-bottom: 20px;">
    By turning muscle activity into sound, Trax Myophone helps you understand when you’re hitting peak performance, correct your form for optimal muscle engagement, and ensure that you’re effectively working the right muscles to grow stronger. It bridges the gap between muscle engagement and awareness, making it easier to find that perfect form and intensity.
    </p>
    <p style="font-size: 18px; max-width: 800px; margin: auto; margin-bottom: 20px;">
    This device solves a critical problem for fitness enthusiasts: knowing when optimal muscle engagement is achieved. In training, even small mistakes in posture or movement can lead to weeks or months of stalled progress. With Trax Myophone, you gain unique insights into muscle activity, enabling you to refine your training techniques and build better, more efficient workout habits.
